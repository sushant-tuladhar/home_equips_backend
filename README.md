## Home Equips Backend:
Using the backend sever is for get, post data into the MYSQL hosted database. It has a schema to show inventory and all the proper details required for the items.
This is the backend APIs which can be reused for other programs as well. Customly, handwritten by Sushant Tuladhar.

For initial you can just use node server.js for starting the server. The higher upgrades would be done later in the program. 
Cheers to coding the program and make use of the node.js
